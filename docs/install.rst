Installation and recommended configuration
==========================================

pwned-passwords-django |release| supports Django 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2 on Python
3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 (Django 4.1 and 4.2 only). Note that Django 3.2's
support for Python 3.10 was added in Django 3.2.9, so you may experience issues
with Python 3.10 and earlier Django 3.2 versions.

.. note:: **Django 3.2 and supported Python versions**

   Django 3.2 was released before Python 3.10 had come out, and although it now
   supports Python 3.10, it did not officially do so until the Django 3.2.9
   release. You may encounter problems if you try to use Django 3.2.8 or
   earlier with Python 3.10.

   Also, although Django 3.2 officially supported some older Python versions,
   pwned-passwords-django |release| does not, because the Python core team's
   support window for those versions has ended..


Installing pwned-passwords-django
---------------------------------

To install pwned-passwords-django, run the following command from a command
prompt/terminal:

.. tab:: macOS/Linux/other Unix

   .. code-block:: shell

      python -m pip install pwned-passwords-django

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: shell

      py -m pip install pwned-passwords-django

This will use ``pip``, the standard Python package-installation tool. If you
are using a supported version of Python, your installation of Python should
have come with ``pip`` bundled. If ``pip`` does not appear to be present, you
can try running the following from a command prompt/terminal:

.. tab:: macOS/Linux/other Unix

   .. code-block:: shell

      python -m ensurepip --upgrade

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: shell

      py -m ensurepip --upgrade

Instructions are also available for `how to obtain and manually install or
upgrade pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/>`_.

If you don't already have a supported version of Django installed, using
``pip`` to install pwned-passwords-django will also install the latest
supported version of Django.


Recommended configuration
-------------------------

The recommended default configuration is to enable both :ref:`the password
validator <validator>` and :ref:`the automatic password-checking middleware
<middleware>`. To do this, make the following changes to your Django settings.

First, add :ref:`the validator <validator>` to your
:setting:`AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` list:

.. code-block:: python

   AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
       # ... other password validators ...
       {
           "NAME": "pwned_passwords_django.validators.PwnedPasswordsValidator",
       },
   ]

Then, add :ref:`the middleware <middleware>` to your :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`
list:

.. code-block:: python

   MIDDLEWARE = [
       # .. other middlewares ...
       "pwned_passwords_django.middleware.pwned_passwords_middleware",
   ]
