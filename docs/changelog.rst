Changelog
=========

This document lists changes between released versions of
pwned-passwords-django.

2.1 -- released 2024-02-??
--------------------------

No new features or bug fixes. Supported Django versions are now 3.2, 4.2, and
5.0; supported Python versions are 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

Source code formatting was updated to Black 2024 style.

Some internal test code was rewritten to use HTTPX ``MockTransport`` objects.


2.0 -- released 2023-03-26
--------------------------

Major version bump. Much of the codebase has been rewritten and improved.

The following changes in 2.0 are backwards-incompatible with 1.x releases:


Configuration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1.x, pwned-passwords-django was configured by two top-level Django settings:
``PWNED_PASSWORDS_API_TIMEOUT`` and ``PWNED_PASSWORDS_REGEX``. As of 2.0,
configuration uses one top-level Django setting, ``PWNED_PASSWORDS``, which is
a :class:`dict` containing any of :ref:`several optional keys <settings>` to
configure behavior.

Here is an example of old 1.x configuration:

.. code-block:: python

   PWNED_PASSWORDS_API_TIMEOUT = 1.5 # one and a half seconds

   PWNED_PASSWORDS_REGEX = r"TOKEN"

And here is the corresponding configuration for 2.0:

.. code-block:: python

   PWNED_PASSWORDS = {
       "API_TIMEOUT": 1.5, # one and a half seconds
       "PASSWORD_REGEX": r"TOKEN",
   }


Validator changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1.x, when the password validator encountered an error communicating with
Pwned Passwords, it would fall back to Django's
:class:`~django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator` after
logging a message of log level :data:`logging.WARNING`. In 2.0, it continues to
fall back to ``CommonPasswordValidator``, but the log message is now of log
level :data:`logging.ERROR`.


Middleware changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1.x, the middleware was a class --
``pwned_passwords_django.middleware.PwnedPasswordsMiddleware`` -- while in 2.0
it is a factory function,
:func:`pwned_passwords_django.middleware.pwned_passwords_middleware`. If you
were using the middleware, you will need to update your :setting:`MIDDLEWARE`
setting.

The middleware in 2.0 supports both synchronous and asynchronous usage, and
will automatically select the correct sync or async code path on a per-request
basis, including use of a sync or async HTTP client to make requests to Pwned
Passwords.

In 1.x, the middleware set the ``request.pwned_passwords`` attribute to a
:class:`dict`, where the keys were keys from
:attr:`~django.http.HttpRequest.POST` that contained compromised passwords, and
the values were the corresponding breach counts for those passwords. In 2.0,
``request.pwned_passwords`` is a :class:`list` of :class:`str`, whose elements
are the keys from :attr:`~django.http.HttpRequest.POST` that contained
compromised passwords. This means that it is no longer possible to get the
breach count for a password from the middleware.

However, the format of ``request.pwned_passwords`` in 1.x meant that the
middleware could not have a consistent fallback in case of errors communicating
with Pwned Passwords; as a result of the change to a :class:`list` in 2.0, the
middleware is now able to fall back to Django's
:class:`~django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator` when
an error occurs in a request to Pwned Passwords, which is a safer failure mode
than was previously possible. This also brings makes the behavior of the
middleware consistent with the validator; see :ref:`the new error-handling
documentation <exceptions>` for details.

Also, as with the validator, the log message recorded when an error occurs
communicating with Pwned Passwords has been changed from log level
:data:`logging.WARNING` to :data:`logging.ERROR`.


Direct API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1.x, direct access to the Pwned Passwords API was available through the
function ``pwned_passwords_django.api.pwned_password``, which took a password
and returned either the count of times it had been breached, or :data:`None` in
the event of an error.

In 2.0, this has been replaced by two functions: the synchronous
:func:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.check_password`, and the asynchronous
:func:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.check_password_async`. Both of these
functions take a password and return a count of times it has been breached;
rather than returning :data:`None` or some other sentinel value, they raise
exceptions in the event of errors communicating with Pwned Passwords. Your code
which calls these functions is responsible for catching and handling exceptions
raised from them; see :ref:`the new error-handling documentation <exceptions>`
for details.

A new :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.PwnedPasswords` API client class is
also provided; the above-mentioned functions are aliases to methods of a
default instance of this client class. See :ref:`the direct API access
documentation <api>` for details of how it may be used and customized.


Error handling changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1.x, errors were caught and handled in a variety of different ways by
different parts of pwned-passwords-django. In 2.0, error handling is much more
unified:

* All external exceptions raised when communicating with Pwned Passwords are
  caught and wrapped in
  :exc:`~pwned_passwords_django.exceptions.PwnedPasswordsError`, meaning that
  code which works with pwned-passwords-django should only need to catch and be
  able to understand that one exception class.

* All exception paths also consistently log messages of log level
  :data:`logging.ERROR`.

* As noted above, the validator and middleware error handling has been made
  consistent: both will fall back to Django's ``CommonPasswordValidator`` in
  the event of errors communicating with Pwned Passwords.

Additionally, as a side effect of better/more unified error handling, code
paths in pwned-passwords-django that handle passwords or likely passwords now
have had Django's :func:`~django.views.decorators.debug.sensitive_variables`
decorator applied to help prevent accidental appearance of raw password values
in error reports, and the explicit error-handling code in
pwned-passwords-django deliberately minimizes the amount of information
reported for unknown/unanticipated exceptions, to further reduce the risk of
this issue.

See :ref:`the error-handling documentation <error-handling>` for details.


Dependency changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1.x, the underlying HTTP client library for communicating with Pwned
Passwords was `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. In 2.0,
it is `HTTPX <https://www.python-httpx.org>`_, which is broadly API-compatible
but provides several additional features (such as async support). The new
:class:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.PwnedPasswords` API client class can use an
instance of any object API-compatible with ``httpx.Client`` as its synchronous
client, and any object API-compatible with ``httpx.AsyncClient`` as its
asynchronous client. This means that, for example, a ``requests.Session`` could
still be passed in to a custom
:class:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.PwnedPasswords` instance and used as the
synchronous HTTP client, if desired (though see the note in the documentation
of :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.PwnedPasswords` regarding error handling
with alternate HTTP clients).

In 1.x, the test suite and continuous integration of pwned-passwords-django
were orchestrated using the ``tox`` automation tool. In 2.0, they are
orchestrated using `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/>`_ instead.


1.6.1 -- released 2022-12-26
----------------------------

"Bugfix" release: the Pwned Passwords API now sometimes returns the
count as a value with a comma in it, which requires additional
handling. No other changes; a release for official compatibility with
Python 3.11 and Django 4.1 will occur later.

1.6 -- released 2022-05-19
--------------------------

No new features. No new bug fixes. Django 4.0 is now supported. Python
3.6, Django 2.2, and Django 3.1 are no longer supported, as they have
reached the end of their upstream support cycles.

1.5 -- released 2021-06-21
--------------------------

No new features. No bug fixes. Django 3.2 is now supported; Django 3.0
and Python 3.5 are no longer supported, as they have both reached the
end of their upstream support cycles.

1.4 -- released 2020-01-28
--------------------------

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The
  :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.validators.PwnedPasswordsValidator`
  is now serializable. This is unlikely to be useful, however, as the
  validator is not intended to be attached to a model.

Other changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The supported versions of Django are now 2.2 and 3.0. This means
  Python 2 support is dropped; if you still need to use
  pwned-passwords-django on Python 2 with Django 1.11, stay with the
  1.3 release series of pwned-passwords-django.

1.3.2 -- released 2019-05-07
----------------------------

No new features. No bug fixes. Released to add explicit markers of
Django 2.2 compatibility.


1.3.1 -- released 2018-09-18
----------------------------

Released to include documentation updates which were inadvertently
left out of the 1.3 package.


1.3 -- released 2018-09-18
--------------------------

No new features. No bug fixes. Released only to add explicit markers of
Python 3.7 and Django 2.1 compatibility.


1.2.1 -- released 2018-06-18
----------------------------

Released to correct the date of the 1.2 release listed in this
changelog document. No other changes.


1.2 -- released 2018-06-18
--------------------------

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Password-validator error messages are now :ref:`customizable
  <validator-messages>`.

* The request-timeout value for contacting the Pwned Passwords API
  defaults to one second, and is customizable via the setting
  :data:`~django.conf.settings.PWNED_PASSWORDS_API_TIMEOUT`.

* When a request to the Pwned Passwords API times out, or encounters
  an error, it logs the problem with a message of level
  :data:`logging.WARNING`. The
  :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.validators.PwnedPasswordsValidator`
  will fall back to
  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator`,
  which has a smaller list of common passwords. The
  :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.middleware.PwnedPasswordsMiddleware`
  does not have a fallback behavior;
  :func:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.pwned_password` will return
  :data:`None` to indicate the error case.

Bugs fixed:
~~~~~~~~~~~

N/A

Other changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :func:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.pwned_password` will now raise
  :exc:`TypeError` if its argument is not a Unicode string (the type
  :class:`unicode` on Python 2, :class:`str` on Python 3). This is
  debatably backwards-incompatible;
  :func:`~pwned_passwords_django.api.pwned_password` encodes its
  argument to UTF-8 bytes, which will raise :exc:`AttributeError` if
  attempted on a :class:`bytes` object in Python 3. As a result, all
  supported environments other than Python 2.7/Django 1.11 would
  already raise :exc:`AttributeError` (due to :class:`bytes` objects
  lacking the :meth:`~str.encode` method) in both 1.0 and
  1.1. Enforcing the :exc:`TypeError` on all supported environments
  ensures users of pwned-passwords-django do not write code that
  accidentally works in one and only one environment, and supplies a
  more accurate and comprehensible exception than the
  :exc:`AttributeError` which would have been raised in previous
  versions.

* The default error and help messages of
  :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.validators.PwnedPasswordsValidator`
  now match the messages of Django's
  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator`. Since
  :class:`~pwned_passwords_django.validators.PwnedPasswordsValidator`
  falls back to
  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator`
  when the Pwned Passwords API is unresponsive, this provides
  consistency of messages, and also ensures the messages are
  translated (Django provides translations for its built-in messages).


1.1 -- released 2018-03-06
----------------------------

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

N/A

Bugs fixed:
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Case sensitivity issue. The Pwned Passwords API always uses
  uppercase hexadecimal digits for password hashes;
  pwned-passwords-django was using lowercase. Fixed by switching
  pwned-passwords-django to use uppercase.

Other changes
